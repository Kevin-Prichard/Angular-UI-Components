A set of components that I build for myself while working on a project.

The component set includes a wrapper for JQuery UI's

Tab
Drag and Drop
Resize
accordion


The component set also contains 

A custom component for 

Flash ( loads flash swf's using swfobject behind the scenes. )

Codemirror - The awesome text editor with syntax highlighting written in js.

jquery masonry - Pinterest layouts made easy.


This should also work as a good example set for whoever is attempting to write their own directives, since it covers quite a few cases.
